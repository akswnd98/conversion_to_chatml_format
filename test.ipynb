Its holding, along with those of its companion cases of Virginia v.

Gangkhar Puensum lies on the border between Bhutan and Tibet.[3] After Bhutan was opened for mountaineering in 1983, there were four expeditions that resulted in failed summit attempts in 1985 and 1986.[4] In 1999, a Japanese expedition successfully climbed Liankang Kangri, a 7,535 metres (24,721\\xa0ft) subsidiary peak (not an independent mountain), separated from the main peak by a 2 kilometres (1.2\\xa0mi) long ridge to the north-northwest.. Since 2003, mountaineering has been banned in Bhutan.[5]. The elevation of Gangkhar Puensum was first measured in 1922 but, until recent years, maps of the region were not at all accurate and the mountain was shown in different locations and with markedly different heights. Indeed, because of inadequate mapping, the first team to attempt the summit was unable to find the mountain at all.[4].\\nThought 3: Gangkhar Puensum is 7,570 metres (24,836\\xa0ft) high. 7,245\\xa0m (Apsarasas Kangri) < 7,570 metres (Gangkhar Puensum), so Apsarasas Kangri is shorter than Gangkhar Puensum.\\nAction 3: Finish[no]'},\n",

The term genius can also be used to refer to people characterised by genius, and/or to polymaths who excel across many subjects.[2]. There is no scientifically precise definition of genius.[3] When used to refer to the characteristic, genius is associated with talent, but several authors such as Cesare Lombroso and Arthur Schopenhauer systematically distinguish these terms.[4] Walter Isaacson, biographer of many well-known geniuses, explains that although high intelligence may be a prerequisite, the most common trait that actually defines a genius may be the extraordinary ability to apply creativity and imaginative thinking to almost any situation.[2]. In ancient Rome, the genius (plural in Latin genii) was the guiding spirit or tutelary deity of a person, family (gens), or place (genius loci).[18] Connotations of the word in Latin have a lineal relationship with the Greek word daemon [19][20][21] in classical and medieval texts, and also share a relationship with the Arabic word al-ghul (as in the star Algol; its literal meaning being \"the Demon\").[22]. The noun is related to the Latin verbs \"gignere\" (to beget, to give birth to) and \"generare\" (to beget, to generate, to procreate), and derives directly from the Indo-European stem thereof: \"ǵenh\" (to produce, to beget, to give birth).\\nThought 2: Genius is a characteristic of original and exceptional insight in the performance of some art or endeavor that surpasses expectations.

Utricularia are cultivated for their flowers, which are often compared with those of snapdragons and orchids, especially amongst carnivorous plant enthusiasts.. All Utricularia are carnivorous and capture small organisms by means of bladder-like traps. Terrestrial species tend to have tiny traps that feed on minute prey such as protozoa and rotifers swimming in water-saturated soil. The traps can range in size from 0.02 to 1.2\\xa0cm (0.008 to 0.5\\xa0in).[2] Aquatic species, such as U.\\xa0vulgaris (common bladderwort), possess bladders that are usually larger and can feed on more substantial prey such as water fleas (Daphnia), nematodes and even fish fry, mosquito larvae and young tadpoles.\\nThought 2: Utricularia is widespread in nature.

It claimed to be a nonpartisan movement, and aimed to unite all the people of  Austria, overcoming political and social divisions.[14] Established on 20 May 1933 by Christian Social Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss as the only legally permitted party in the country, it was organised along the lines of Italian Fascism, was fully aligned with the Catholic Church, and did not advocate any racial ideology, as Italian Fascism later did. It advocated Austrian nationalism and independence from Germany on the basis of protecting Austria\\'s Catholic religious identity from what they considered a Protestant-dominated German state.[15]. The Fatherland Front, which was strongly linked with Austria\\'s Catholic clergy, absorbed Dollfuss\\'s Christian Social Party, the agrarian Landbund and the right-wing paramilitary Heimwehren, all of which were opposed to Marxism, laissez-faire capitalism and liberal democracy.

Having served as Minister for Forests and Agriculture, he ascended to Federal Chancellor in 1932 in the midst of a crisis for the conservative government. In early 1933, the so called \"Selbstausschaltung des Parlaments\" happened, which made the Austrian parliament unable to govern. Suppressing the Socialist movement in February 1934 during the Austrian Civil War and later banning the Austrian Nazi Party, he cemented the rule of authoritarian conservatism through the First of May Constitution.

Like many prohibition-era cocktails, the damn the weather was conceived as a way to hide the scent and flavor of poor quality homemade spirits, in this case bathtub gin.[1] The original recipe was included in Harry Craddock's 1930 The Savoy Cocktail Book.[1] A bar/restaurant in Seattle takes its name from the drink.[1].

Some claim it is the oldest known American cocktail,[2] with origins in antebellum New Orleans, although drink historian David Wondrich is among those who dispute this,[3] and American instances of published usage of the word cocktail to describe a mixture of spirits, bitters, and sugar can be traced to the dawn of the 19th century.[4]. The defining feature of the Sazerac is its method of preparation, which commonly involves two chilled old-fashioned glasses. The first glass is swirled with a wash of absinthe for its flavor and strong scent.[5] The second glass is used to combine the remaining ingredients, which are stirred with ice, then strained into the first glass.[6] Various anisettes such as pastis, Pernod, or Herbsaint are common substitutes when absinthe is unavailable.\\nThought 3: Sazerac is not considered a Prohibition Era cocktail.

The .45 GAP is the first commercially introduced cartridge that has been identified with Glock.. The .45 GAP has the same diameter as the .45 ACP pistol cartridge but is slightly shorter, and uses a small-pistol primer instead of the large-pistol primer most commonly used in .45 ACP ammunition. Originally, the maximum bullet weight of the .45 GAP was 200 grains (13\\xa0g). In order to provide terminal ballistics that matched the standard 230-grain (15\\xa0g) .45 ACP loads, the .45 GAP was designed to operate at a higher standard pressure—roughly equivalent to the higher pressures found in .45 ACP \"+P\" rounds.\\nThought 2: The producer of .45 GAP is Glock.

Bacon led the advancement of both natural philosophy and the scientific method and his works remained influential even in the late stages of the Scientific Revolution.[6].

He believed that science could be achieved by the use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves.

In 2007, The Washington Post referred to them as \"an arena-rock juggernaut\" and described their music as \"Pink Floyd meets Yes and the Who at Radio City Music Hall.\"[6] TSO has sold more than 10 million concert tickets and over 10 million albums.[5][7] The band has released a series of rock operas: Christmas Eve and Other Stories, The Christmas Attic, Beethoven\\'s Last Night, The Lost Christmas Eve, their two-disc Night Castle and Letters From the Labyrinth.[5] Trans-Siberian Orchestra is also known for their extensive charity work and elaborate concerts, which include a string section, a light show, lasers, moving trusses, video screens, and effects synchronized to music.[3]. Both Billboard Magazine and Pollstar have ranked them as one of the top twenty-five ticket-selling bands in the first decade of the new millennium.[8][9] Their path to success was unusual in that, according to O\\'Neill, TSO is the first major rock band to go straight to theaters and arenas, having never played at a club, never having been an opening act and never having had an opening act.[10].

Born to Jewish-Ukrainian parents in Chile, Jodorowsky experienced an unhappy and alienated childhood, and so immersed himself in reading and writing poetry. Dropping out of college, he became involved in theater and in particular mime, working as a clown before founding his own theater troupe, the Teatro Mimico, in 1947. Moving to Paris in the early 1950s, Jodorowsky studied traditional mime under Étienne Decroux, and put his miming skills to use in the silent film Les têtes interverties (1957), directed with Saul Gilbert and Ruth Michelly.\\nThought 3: Alejandro Jodorowsky is a Chilean-French avant-garde filmmaker.

The airport opened in 1951 and took over existing scheduled airline traffic to Fairbanks, which had previously used Ladd Army Airfield.[5] Alaska Airlines used Fairbanks as its main hub in the 1950s, with service to Seattle and Portland as well as intrastate service to Anchorage, Nome and other destinations.[6] By 1967, however, the airline shifted its Alaska hub to Anchorage; its Anchorage-Fairbanks service continues to this day.[7] In the mid-1970s, following the development of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, Alaska Airlines and Braniff International offered \"interchange service\" between Fairbanks and Houston via Anchorage, Seattle and Dallas.[8] In 1982, following airline deregulation, Alaska Airlines and American Airlines began a similar interchange service using Boeing 727s.[9].

During 1890 to 1920 “thousands of Jewish immigrants” came to the United States, seeking “respite from persecution, a place safe from repression and pogroms, and an opportunity to make a decent living.”[6] By the end of the nineteenth century, many Jewish Americans “were in a position to live as other bourgeois Americans did” and “emulate the lifestyle of middle-class WASPS.\"[3] Specifically, “middle-class Jews of both sexes were emulating the folkways of the WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) community but were not integrated into it. They dressed, entertained and furnished their homes according to the patterns set by the majority but they celebrated different holidays and often found themselves unwelcome in gentile society.\"[3].

In Maharashtra, such signage is a violation of Section 134 (1) of the Maharashtra Motor Vehicle Rules.[4]. Bal Malkit Singh, former president of the All India Motor Transport Congress, welcomed the ban, stating that the phrase was required in the past when the roads were narrow; but that on modern wide roads and multi-lane highways, drivers could use lights and indicators to overtake other vehicles.[5].

In addition, several incidents, of which the Forest of Fontainebleau scene and auto-da-fé were the most substantial, were borrowed from Eugène Cormon\\'s 1846 play Philippe II, Roi d\\'Espagne.[2] The opera is most often performed in Italian translation, usually under the title Don Carlo..

The novella has been widely translated, with English versions titled Candide: or, All for the Best (1759); Candide: or, The Optimist (1762); and Candide: Optimism (1947).[7] It begins with a young man, Candide, who is living a sheltered life in an Edenic paradise and being indoctrinated with Leibnizian optimism by his mentor, Professor Pangloss.[8] The work describes the abrupt cessation of this lifestyle, followed by Candide\\'s slow and painful disillusionment as he witnesses and experiences great hardships in the world. Voltaire concludes Candide with, if not rejecting Leibnizian optimism outright, advocating a deeply practical precept, \"we must cultivate our garden\", in lieu of the Leibnizian mantra of Pangloss, \"all is for the best\" in the \"best of all possible worlds\".. Candide is characterized by its  tone as well as by its erratic, fantastical, and fast-moving plot. A picaresque novel with a story similar to that of a more serious coming-of-age narrative (bildungsroman), it parodies many adventure and romance clichés, the struggles of which are caricatured in a tone that is bitter and matter-of-fact.\\nThought 3: Candide is not an opera.

Mead has been described as \"the artist who illustrates the future\" and \"one of the most influential concept artists and industrial designers of our time.\"[4][5]. Mead was born on July 18, 1933, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. His father was a Baptist minister, who read him pulp magazines, such as Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon, sparking his interest in science fiction. Mead was skilled in drawing at a young age.\\nThought 2: Syd Mead\\'s designs are Blade Runner, Aliens and Tron. I need to search each of them and find which one is directed by Ridley Scott.\\nAction 2: Search[Blade Runner]\\nObservation 2: Blade Runner is a 1982 science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott, and written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples.[7][8] Starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, and Edward James Olmos, it is an adaptation of Philip K. Dick\\'s 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? The film is set in a dystopian future Los Angeles of 2019, in which synthetic humans known as replicants are bio-engineered by the powerful Tyrell Corporation to work on space colonies. When a fugitive group of advanced replicants led by Roy Batty (Hauer) escapes back to Earth, burnt-out cop Rick Deckard (Ford) reluctantly agrees to hunt them down.. Blade Runner initially underperformed in North American theaters and polarized critics; some praised its thematic complexity and visuals, while others critiqued its slow pacing and lack of action. The film\\'s soundtrack, composed by Vangelis, was nominated in 1982 for a BAFTA and a Golden Globe as best original score.\\nThought 3: Blade Runner is directed by Ridley Scott.

Set in the far future, it stars Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, the sole survivor of an alien attack on her ship. When communications are lost with a human colony on the moon where her crew first saw the alien creatures, Ripley agrees to return to the site with a unit of Colonial Marines to investigate. Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, and Carrie Henn are featured in supporting roles..\\nThought 5: Aliens is directed by James Cameron. I need to search Tron next.\\nAction 5: Search[Tron]\\nObservation 5: Tron (stylized as TRON) is a 1982 American science fiction action adventure film written and directed by Steven Lisberger from a story by Lisberger and Bonnie MacBird. The film stars Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn, a computer programmer and video game developer who is transported inside the software world of a mainframe computer where he interacts with programs in his attempt to escape; it also stars Bruce Boxleitner, David Warner, Cindy Morgan, and Barnard Hughes. Tron, along with The Last Starfighter, has the distinction of being one of cinema\\'s earliest films to use extensive computer-generated imagery (CGI).. The inspiration for Tron dates back to 1976, when Lisberger became intrigued with video games after seeing Pong. He and producer Donald Kushner set up an animation studio to develop Tron with the intention of making it an animated film.\\nThought 6: Tron is directed by Steven Lisberger.

Sarajevo is the political, financial, social, and cultural center of Bosnia and Herzegovina and a prominent center of culture in the Balkans. It exerts region-wide influence in entertainment, media, fashion, and the arts.[7][8] Due to its long history of religious and cultural diversity, Sarajevo is sometimes called the \"Jerusalem of Europe\"[1] or \"Jerusalem of the Balkans\".[2] It is one of a few major European cities to have a mosque, Catholic church, Eastern Orthodox church, and synagogue within the same neighborhood.[9]. Although there is evidence of human settlement in the area since prehistoric times, the modern city arose in the 15th century as an Ottoman stronghold when the latter empire extended into Europe.[10] Sarajevo has gained international renown several times throughout its history. In 1885, it was the first city in Europe and the second city in the world to have a full-time electric tram network running through the city, following San Francisco.[11] In 1914, it was the site of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a local Young Bosnia activist Gavrilo Princip, a murder that sparked World War I.\\nThought 4: Sarajevo is surrounded by Dinaric Alps.

The film tells the story of Brian Cohen (played by Chapman), a young Jewish-Roman man who is born on the same day as—and next door to—Jesus, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.. Following the withdrawal of funding by EMI Films just days before production was scheduled to begin, George Harrison, the former member of the Beatles and a long-time Python fan, arranged financing for Life of Brian through the formation of his HandMade Films company.[4].

In common with the controversy surrounding the film, the album was banned in Ireland after Father Brian D\\'Arcy highlighted how it had worked its way through a loophole in the country\\'s censorship laws, claiming \"Anybody who buys the record and finds it funny must have something wrong with their mentality\".[4] Nevertheless, the album reached No.63 in the UK Albums Chart.[5].

Spiders (order Araneae) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight limbs, chelicerae with fangs generally able to inject venom,[2] and spinnerets that extrude silk.[3] They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all orders of organisms.[4][5] Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica, and have become established in nearly every land habitat. As of November\\xa02023[update], 51,673 spider species in 136 families have been recorded by taxonomists.[1] However, there has been debate among scientists about how families should be classified, with over 20 different classifications proposed since 1900.[6]. Anatomically, spiders (as with all arachnids) differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax or prosoma, and the opisthosoma, or abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel. However, as there is currently neither paleontological nor embryological evidence that spiders ever had a separate thorax-like division, there exists an argument against the validity of the term cephalothorax, which means fused cephalon (head) and the thorax.\\nThought 2: Spider does not have director.

Tradition credits Moses as the author of Genesis, as well as the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and most of Deuteronomy; however, modern scholars, especially from the 19th century onward, place the books\\' authorship in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, hundreds of years after Moses is supposed to have lived.[3][4] Based on scientific interpretation of archaeological, genetic, and linguistic evidence, most mainstream Bible scholars consider Genesis to be primarily mythological rather than historical.. It is divisible into two parts, the primeval history (chapters 1–11) and the ancestral history (chapters 12–50).[5] The primeval history sets out the author\\'s concepts of the nature of the deity and of humankind\\'s relationship with its maker: God creates a world which is good and fit for humans, but when man corrupts it with sin God decides to destroy his creation, sparing only the righteous Noah and his family to re-establish the relationship between man and God.[6] The ancestral history (chapters 12–50) tells of the prehistory of Israel, God\\'s chosen people.[7] At God\\'s command, Noah\\'s descendant Abraham journeys from his birthplace (described as Ur of the Chaldeans and whose identification with Sumerian Ur is tentative in modern scholarship) into the God-given land of Canaan, where he dwells as a sojourner, as does his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob. Jacob\\'s name is changed to \"Israel\", and through the agency of his son Joseph, the children of Israel descend into Egypt, 70 people in all with their households, and God promises them a future of greatness.\\nThought 4: Book of Genesis is a book.

The name \"Wuhan\" came from the city\\'s historical origin from the conglomeration of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang, which are collectively known as the \"Three Towns of Wuhan\" (武汉三镇). Wuhan lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtze river and its largest tributary, the Han River, and is known as \"Nine Provinces\\' Thoroughfare\" (九省通衢).[1] Wuhan was the site of the 1911 Wuchang Uprising against the Qing Dynasty which ended 2,000 years of dynastic rule. Wuhan was briefly the capital of China in 1927 under the left wing of the Kuomintang (KMT) government,[18] and later served as the wartime capital of China for ten months in 1937 during WWII.[19][20] On December 31, 2019, SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus that later caused the COVID-19 pandemic, was first discovered in Wuhan[21][22] and the city was the location of the first lockdown of the pandemic in January 2020.[23].\\nThought 3: Wuhan is not a prefecture-level city.

Sibrel claims that the Moon landing was a hoax, making claims about supposed photographic anomalies; disasters such as the destruction of Apollo 1; technical difficulties experienced in the 1950s and 1960s; and the problems of traversing the Van Allen radiation belts. Sibrel proposes that the most condemning evidence is a piece of footage that he claims was secret, and inadvertently sent to him by NASA; he alleges that the footage shows Apollo 11 astronauts attempting to create the illusion that they were 130,000 miles (210,000\\xa0km) from Earth (or roughly halfway to the Moon) when, he claims, they were only in a low Earth orbit..

The relocated peoples suffered from exposure, disease, and starvation while en route to their newly designated Indian reserve. Thousands died from disease before reaching their destinations or shortly after.[7][8][9][10][11] Some historians have said that the event constituted a genocide, although this label has been rejected by others and remains a matter of debate.. In 1830, a group of Indian nations collectively referred to as the \"Five Civilized Tribes\" (the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee, and Seminole nations), were living autonomously in what would later be termed the American Deep South. The process of cultural transformation from their traditional way of life towards a white American way of life as proposed by George Washington and Henry Knox was gaining momentum, especially among the Cherokee and Choctaw.[12][13].\\nThought 3: Trail of Tears was part of Indian removal. I need to search Indian removal next.\\nAction 3: Search[Indian removal]\\nObservation 3: Indian removal was the United States government policy of forced displacement of self-governing tribes of Native Americans from their ancestral homelands in the eastern United States to lands west of the Mississippi River\\xa0– specifically, to a designated Indian Territory (roughly, present-day Oklahoma).[1][2][3] The Indian Removal Act, the key law which authorized the removal of Native tribes, was signed by Andrew Jackson in 1830. Although Jackson took a hard line on Indian removal, the law was enforced primarily during the Martin Van Buren administration. After the enactment of the Indian Removal Act in 1830, approximately 60,000 members of the Cherokee, Muscogee (Creek), Seminole, Chickasaw, and Choctaw nations (including thousands of their black slaves) were forcibly removed from their ancestral homelands, with thousands dying during the Trail of Tears.[4][5][6][7]. Indian removal, a popular policy among incoming settlers, was a consequence of actions by European settlers in North America during the colonial period and then by the United States government (and its citizens) until the mid-20th century.[8][9] The policy traced its origins to the administration of James Monroe, although it addressed conflicts between European and Native Americans which had occurred since the 17th century and were escalating into the early 19th century (as European settlers pushed westward in the cultural belief of manifest destiny). Historical views of Indian removal have been reevaluated since that time.\\nThought 4: Indian removal was authorized by Indian Removal Act, which was signed by Andrew Jackson in 1830.

Reich\\'s work on character contributed to the development of Anna Freud\\'s The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence (1936), and his idea of muscular armour—the expression of the personality in the way the body moves—shaped innovations such as body psychotherapy, Gestalt therapy, bioenergetic analysis and primal therapy.[6] His writing influenced generations of intellectuals; he coined the phrase \"the sexual revolution\" and according to one historian acted as its midwife.[7] During the 1968 student uprisings in Paris and Berlin, students scrawled his name on walls and threw copies of The Mass Psychology of Fascism at police.[8]. After graduating in medicine from the public University of Vienna in 1922, Reich became deputy director of Freud\\'s outpatient clinic, the Vienna Ambulatorium.[9] During the 1930s, he was part of a general trend among younger analysts and Frankfurt sociologists that tried to reconcile psychoanalysis with Marxism. He established the first sexual advisory clinics in Vienna, along with Marie Frischauf.[10] He said he wanted to \"attack the neurosis by its prevention rather than treatment\".[11].

The series has been a ratings success in its time slot, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Structured Reality Program four times (2014–2017) in the first four years of that category\\'s existence.[3]. The show features a panel of investors called \"sharks,\" who decide whether to invest as entrepreneurs make business presentations on their company or product.[4][5] The sharks often find weaknesses and faults in an entrepreneur\\'s product, business model or valuation of their company.[6] Some of the investors are usually kindhearted and try to soften the impact of rejection, like panel member Barbara Corcoran, while others such as Kevin O\\'Leary can be \"brutal\" and show \"no patience even for tales of hardship\".[6] The sharks are paid as cast stars of the show, but a disclaimer at the start of each episode states the money they invest is their own.[7] The same disclaimer also states that no offer of investment is being made to the viewer. The entrepreneur can make a handshake deal (gentleman\\'s agreement) on the show if a panel member is interested. However, if all of the panel members opt out, the entrepreneur leaves empty-handed.[6].\\nThought 5: Shark Tank premiered on August 9, 2009, and Plated (meal kits) was featured on it in 2014.

During the off-season, the Bulls signed 43-year old free agent All-Star center Robert Parish, who won three championships with the Boston Celtics in the 1980s.[2][3][4][5] Coming off of one of the greatest seasons in NBA history, the Bulls, on the backs of recording another first-place finish in their division and conference, repeated as NBA champions.

It originates from North Africa and is found in Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and Libya.[3][4][5]. The Sloughi has existed for centuries in North Africa, primarily in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt.[6] The word sloughi is likely a Berber pronunciation of the Arabic saluki, the similarly-looking and -behaving Arabian sighthound; the two breeds likely share a common ancestor.[6] Algerian Neolithic rock paintings, plus tomb paintings and hieroglyphics in Egypt, have been discovered portraying distinctly slender dogs with drooped ears, hinting at the breed's earlier origins.[6]  Sloughis are still used for hunting in North African countries, as well as being  a reliable familial guard dog. The Sloughi was accepted into the FCI in 1998, receiving recognition by the American Kennel Club as recently as January 1, 2016, and being able to compete in the AKC Hound Group.[7][5].

Common throughout family farms in the 1920s and 1930s, they are now recognized by the United (UKC) and American Kennel Clubs (AKC) and are considered a rare breed.[2] Rat Terriers are an intelligent and active breed that can be kept both for pest control and as a family pet.. The Rat Terrier ranges from about 10 to 25 pounds (4.5 to 11.3\\xa0kg) and stands 10 to 18 inches (25 to 46\\xa0cm) at the shoulder. The miniature size—13 inches (33\\xa0cm) and under as defined by the UKC—has become more popular as a house pet and companion dog, but the miniature is still a hunting dog.

The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.. It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.[4].\\nThought 3: Shiloh Shepherd dog is not a rare breed of dog that was derived as a variant. I need to search American Hairless Terrier next.\\nAction 3: Search[American Hairless Terrier]\\nObservation 3: The American Hairless Terrier is a breed of companion dog from the United States that was developed from naturally hairless Rat Terriers.. In 1972, a completely hairless bitch pup was whelped in a litter of purebred Rat Terriers owned by Willie and Edwin Scott of Louisiana.[1][2] Named Josephine, the bitch conformed to the Rat Terrier type in every way except for her coat, so the Scotts bred from her and her first litter produced another hairless bitch pup, Gypsy.[1][2] Neither bitch whelped another hairless pup in multiple litters until, in 1981 at the age of nine, Josephine produced two more hairless pups, a dog and a bitch.[1][2] In 1983 the dog, Snoopy, was mated to his hairless sisters and many more hairless pups were whelped, establishing the foundation stock for the new breed.[1][2] Originally registered as a hairless variety of Rat Terriers, eventually the Scotts adopted a different breed name for their unique line and established a separate breed club, the American Hairless Terrier Association.[1] In 2004 the United Kennel Club recognised the line as a breed and in 2016 the American Kennel Club also recognised the breed.[3][4]. According to the United Kennel Club\\'s breed standard, American Hairless Terriers typically stand between 10 and 18 inches (25 and 46\\xa0cm);[3] the breed typically weighs between 7 and 14 pounds (3.2 and 6.4\\xa0kg).[1] The breed has pricked ears and can be born with either a naturally short tail or a long tail that is never docked.[2]. At birth American Hairless Terriers are born with a light fuzz of hair over their entire body which they gradually shed from the nose backwards until they are entirely naked, this typically occurs by the age of six weeks; they retain eyebrows and whiskers.[1][2] The breed standard states hairless examples’ skin can be any color, although they are usually part colored with freckles that enlarge with age.[3] Because of their lack of hair, the breed is particularly susceptible to hypothermia in cold weather as well as sunburn in sunny conditions.[1][2]. Some American Hairless Terriers are whelped with coats; they are still recognised as examples of the breed.[1][2] The breed standard states coated examples of the breed have a short and dense coat that can be solid white or bi-color, tri-color, sable and brindle, always with some white.[3].\\nThought 4: American Hairless Terrier is a rare breed of dog that was derived as a variant.

According to the manufacturer, Everclear \"should be viewed as an unfinished ingredient\", not consumed directly in undiluted form, and the company acknowledges that the product \"has a rather notorious reputation\" due to its high alcohol content.[5] Rather than consuming Everclear directly, the company says it should be diluted by mixing it with water or other ingredients until the alcohol strength of the drink is \"no more dangerous than other spirits or liqueurs on the shelf\".[5] For example, ordinary vodka, gin, rum and tequila have an alcohol concentration typically around 40% alcohol by volume (80 proof), and liqueurs are typically around 20% alcohol (40 proof).[5]. Everclear is also used as a household \"food-grade\" cleaner, disinfectant, or stove fuel alcohol because its fumes and odor are less offensive than isopropyl, rubbing, and denatured alcohol which are toxic to breathe or drink.\\nThought 3: Everclear is a brand name of rectified spirit.

These treaties expanded the Dominion of Canada with large tracts of land in exchange for promises made to the indigenous people of the area. These terms were dependent on individual negotiations and so specific terms differed with each treaty.. These treaties came in two waves—Numbers 1 through 7 from 1871 to 1877 and Numbers 8 through 11 from 1899 to 1921.

It is normally worn as part of Scottish military or civilian Highland dress, either formal or informal, as an alternative to the Balmoral bonnet or Tam o\\' Shanter.. Traditionally, the Glengarry bonnet is said to have first appeared as the head dress of the Glengarry Fencibles when they were formed in 1794 by Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry, of Clan MacDonell of Glengarry. MacDonell, therefore, is sometimes said to have invented the Glengarry – but it is not clear whether early pictures of civilians or Fencible infantry show a true glengarry, capable of being folded flat, or the standard military bonnet of the period merely cocked into a more \"fore-and-aft\" shape.[1] The first use of the classic, military glengarry may not have been until 1841, when it is said to have been introduced for the pipers of the 79th Foot by the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Lauderdale Maule.[2].

The term \"American Dream\" was popularized by James Truslow Adams in 1931, saying that \"life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement\" regardless of social class or circumstances of birth.[1]. Proponents of the American Dream often claim that its tenets originate from the United States Declaration of Independence, which states that \"all men are created equal\" with the right to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\".[2] The Preamble to the Constitution of the United States is used similarly, and states that the Constitution\\'s purpose is to, in part, \"secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity\".[a]. Throughout American history, there have been critics of its national ethos. Some critics point out that American focus on individualism and capital results in materialism, consumerism, and a lack of worker solidarity.[3] In 2015, only 10.5 percent of American workers were members of a labor union.[4] The American Dream has also been criticized as a product of American exceptionalism, as it does not acknowledge the hardships many Americans face, namely in regards to the legacies of American slavery and Native American genocide, as well as other examples of discriminatory violence.[5].\\nThought 2: The documentary American Dream was released on October 19, 1990.

He wrote biographies of Albinoni and other composers, including Antonio Vivaldi.. Giazotto served as a music critic (from 1932) and editor (1945–1949) of the Rivista musicale italiana and was appointed co-editor of the Nuova rivista musicale italiana in 1967. He was a professor of the history of music at the University of Florence (1957–69) and in 1962 was nominated[clarification needed] to the Accademia Nazionale di S. Cecilia..\\nThought 2: Remo Giazotto died in 1998.

His output includes operas, concertos, sonatas for one to six instruments, sinfonias, and solo cantatas.[1] While famous in his day as an opera composer, he is known today for his instrumental music, especially his concertos.[2] He is best remembered today for a work called \"Adagio in G minor\", attributed to him but largely written by Remo Giazotto, a 20th century musicologist and composer, who was a cataloger of the works of Albinoni.[3]. Born in Venice, to Antonio Albinoni, a wealthy paper merchant, he studied violin and singing. Relatively little is known about his life, which is surprising, considering his contemporary stature as a composer and the comparatively well-documented period in which he lived. In 1694 he dedicated his Opus 1 to the fellow-Venetian, Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni (grand-nephew of Pope Alexander VIII).\\nThought 3: Tomaso Albinoni died in 1751.

A variation of this cheese exists also in Corsica (France), where it is called casgiu merzu,[2] and is especially produced in some Southern Corsican villages like Sartène.[3]. Derived from pecorino, casu martzu goes beyond typical fermentation to a stage of decomposition, brought about by the digestive action of the larvae of the cheese fly of the Piophilidae family.

Various cosmological models of the Big Bang explain the evolution of the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale form.[2][3][4] These models offer a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure. The overall uniformity of the universe, known as the flatness problem, is explained through cosmic inflation: a sudden and very rapid expansion of space during the earliest moments. However, physics currently lacks a widely accepted theory of quantum gravity that can successfully model the earliest conditions of the Big Bang.. Crucially, these models are compatible with the Hubble–Lemaître law—the observation that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from Earth.\\nThought 3: The Big Bang is a physical theory.

Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and emotional attachment.[2]. Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection—\"the unselfish, loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another\"—and its vice representing a human moral flaw akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, potentially leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness, or codependency.[3] It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, oneself, or animals.[4] In its various forms, love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts.[5][6] Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.[7]. Ancient Greek philosophers identified six forms of love: familial love (storge), friendly love or platonic love (philia), romantic love (eros), self-love (philautia), guest love (xenia), and divine or unconditional love (agape).

Eddy described Christian Science as a return to \"primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing\".[10] There are key differences between Christian Science theology and that of traditional Christianity.[11] In particular, adherents subscribe to a radical form of philosophical idealism, believing that reality is purely spiritual and the material world an illusion.[12] This includes the view that disease is a mental error rather than physical disorder, and that the sick should be treated not by medicine but by a form of prayer that seeks to correct the beliefs responsible for the illusion of ill health.[13][14].\\nThought 3: Mary Baker Eddy founded Christian Science.

After they finished their studies and returned to Latin America, they adopted positions in numerous South American governments including the military dictatorship of Chile (1973–1990), as economic advisors. Many of them reached the highest positions within those governments.[1] Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were influenced by Chile\\'s policies and economic reforms.[2]. The term \"Chicago Boys\" has been used at least as early as the 1980s[3] to describe Latin American economists who studied or identified with the liberal economic theories then taught at the University of Chicago, even though some of them earned degrees at Harvard University or MIT.

Friedman\\'s challenges to what he called \"naive Keynesian theory\"[9] began with his interpretation of consumption, which tracks how consumers spend. He introduced a theory which would later become part of mainstream economics and among the first to propagate the theory of consumption smoothing.[4][10] During the 1960s, he became the main advocate opposing Keynesian government policies,[11] and described his approach (along with mainstream economics) as using \"Keynesian language and apparatus\" yet rejecting its initial conclusions.[12] He theorized that there existed a natural rate of unemployment and argued that unemployment below this rate would cause inflation to accelerate.[a][13] He argued that the Phillips curve was in the long run vertical at the \"natural rate\" and predicted what would come to be known as stagflation.[14] Friedman promoted a macroeconomic viewpoint known as monetarism and argued that a steady, small expansion of the money supply was the preferred policy, as compared to rapid, and unexpected changes.[15] His ideas concerning monetary policy, taxation, privatization and deregulation influenced government policies, especially during the 1980s. His monetary theory influenced the Federal Reserve\\'s monetary policy in response to the global financial crisis of 2007–2008.[16].

It is also in contrast to theistic evolution, which posits that the scientific principles of evolution, the Big Bang, abiogenesis, solar nebular theory, age of the universe, and age of Earth are compatible with a metaphorical interpretation of the Genesis creation account.[9]. Since the mid-20th century, young Earth creationists—starting with Henry Morris (1918–2006)—have developed and promoted a pseudoscientific[10] explanation called creation science as a basis for a religious belief in a supernatural, geologically recent creation, in response to the scientific acceptance of Charles Darwin\\'s Theory of Evolution, which was developed over the previous century. Contemporary YEC movements arose in protest to the scientific consensus, established by numerous scientific disciplines, which demonstrates that the age of the universe is around 13.8 billion years, the formation of the Earth and Solar System happened around 4.6 billion years ago, and the origin of life occurred roughly 4 billion years ago.[11][12][13][14]. A 2017 Gallup creationism survey found that 38 percent of adults in the United States held the view that \"God created humans in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years\" when asked for their views on the origin and development of human beings, which Gallup noted was the lowest level in 35 years.[15] It was suggested that the level of support could be lower when poll results are adjusted after comparison with other polls with questions that more specifically account for uncertainty and ambivalence.[16] Gallup found that, when asking a similar question in 2019, 40 percent of US adults held the view that \"God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so\".[17].\\nThought 2: Young Earth creationism believes that God created the universe, Earth, and all life on Earth.

Also, he often served as Charles\\' representative in the Holy Roman Empire and developed encouraging relationships with German princes. In addition, Ferdinand also developed valuable relationships with the German banking house of Jakob Fugger and the Catalan bank, Banca Palenzuela Levi Kahana.. The key events during his reign were the conflict with the Ottoman Empire, which in the 1520s began a great advance into Central Europe, and the Protestant Reformation, which resulted in several wars of religion. Although not a military leader, Ferdinand was a capable organizer with institutional imagination who focused on building a centralized government for Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia instead of striving for universal monarchy.[3][4] He reintroduced major innovations of his grandfather Maximilian I such as the Hofrat (court council) with a chancellery and a treasury attached to it (this time, the structure would last until the reform of Maria Theresa) and added innovations of his own such as the Raitkammer (collections office) and the Hofkriegsrat, conceived to counter the threat from the Ottoman Empire, while also successfully subduing the most radical of his rebellious Austrian subjects and turning the political class in Bohemia and Hungary into Habsburg partners.[5][6] While he was able to introduce uniform models of administration, the governments of Austria, Bohemia and Hungary remained distinct though.[7][8] His approach to Imperial problems, including governance, human relations and religious matters was generally flexible, moderate and tolerant.[9][10][11] Ferdinand\\'s motto was Fiat iustitia, et pereat mundus: \"Let justice be done, though the world perish\".[12].\\nThought 6: Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor was born on March 10, 1503.
